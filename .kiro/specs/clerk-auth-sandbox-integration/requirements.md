# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document specifies the requirements for integrating Clerk Authentication and implementing Sandbox Mode functionality in the DevShowcase platform. The DevShowcase platform is a Django + React SaaS application where users create and showcase their development projects. This integration will replace the existing DRF Token Authentication with Clerk JWT authentication and add isolated sandbox environments for testing API endpoints without calling external APIs or modifying real data.

## Glossary

- **Clerk_Authentication_System**: The Clerk JWT-based authentication service that validates user identity via JSON Web Tokens
- **Backend_Authentication_Handler**: The Django REST Framework authentication class that validates Clerk JWT tokens
- **Frontend_Auth_Provider**: The React component that wraps the application with Clerk authentication context
- **Sandbox_Environment**: An isolated testing environment associated with a project containing mock data collections
- **Sandbox_Collection**: A named data collection within a sandbox environment representing a resource type (e.g., "expenses", "users")
- **Sandbox_Record**: An individual data item stored within a sandbox collection
- **Sandbox_Service**: The backend service layer that handles sandbox request execution logic
- **Execution_View**: The Django view that processes API endpoint execution requests
- **Project_Owner**: An authenticated user who owns a project
- **Public_User**: An unauthenticated user accessing published projects
- **Rate_Limiter**: The system component that enforces request rate limits per IP address
- **External_API**: Any third-party API endpoint that exists outside the DevShowcase platform
- **JWKS_Endpoint**: The JSON Web Key Set endpoint provided by Clerk for token verification
- **JWT_Token**: A JSON Web Token issued by Clerk containing user identity claims

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Clerk Backend Authentication

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the backend to validate Clerk JWT tokens, so that users can authenticate securely using Clerk.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a request contains a Bearer token in the Authorization header, THE Backend_Authentication_Handler SHALL extract the JWT_Token from the header
2. WHEN validating a JWT_Token, THE Backend_Authentication_Handler SHALL fetch the JWKS_Endpoint from the configured Clerk domain
3. WHEN validating a JWT_Token, THE Backend_Authentication_Handler SHALL verify the token signature using the RS256 algorithm and the public key from JWKS_Endpoint
4. WHEN validating a JWT_Token, THE Backend_Authentication_Handler SHALL verify the token audience matches the configured Clerk frontend API identifier
5. WHEN validating a JWT_Token, THE Backend_Authentication_Handler SHALL verify the token has not expired
6. WHEN a valid JWT_Token is decoded, THE Backend_Authentication_Handler SHALL extract the user ID from the "sub" claim
7. WHEN a valid JWT_Token is decoded, THE Backend_Authentication_Handler SHALL create or retrieve a Django User with username matching the user ID
8. IF the JWT_Token signature is invalid, THEN THE Backend_Authentication_Handler SHALL return an authentication failed error
9. IF the JWT_Token has expired, THEN THE Backend_Authentication_Handler SHALL return a token expired error
10. IF the JWT_Token audience does not match, THEN THE Backend_Authentication_Handler SHALL return an authentication failed error

### Requirement 2: Clerk Frontend Integration

8. THE Frontend_Auth_Provider SHALL provide loading state while authentication status is being determined

### Requirement 3: Sandbox Environment Generation

**User Story:** As a project owner, I want to generate a sandbox environment for my project, so that users can test my API endpoints without calling external APIs.

4. WHEN an endpoint has a sample response that is a JSON array, THE Sandbox_Service SHALL create a Sandbox_Record for each array item in the corresponding collection
5. WHEN an endpoint has a sample response that is a JSON object, THE Sandbox_Service SHALL create a single Sandbox_Record with the object data in the corresponding collection
6. WHEN a Sandbox_Environment already exists for a project, THE Sandbox_Service SHALL update the existing environment instead of creating a duplicate
7. WHEN a Sandbox_Record with identical data already exists in a collection, THE Sandbox_Service SHALL skip creating a duplicate record
8. THE Sandbox_Service SHALL return the generated Sandbox_Environment with all collections and records
9. IF a Project_Owner requests sandbox generation for a project they do not own, THEN THE Sandbox_Service SHALL return a not found error

### Requirement 4: Sandbox Request Execution

**User Story:** As a user, I want API requests to execute against sandbox data when available, so that I can test endpoints without affecting real systems.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Execution_View receives an endpoint execution request, THE Execution_View SHALL check if a Sandbox_Environment exists for the endpoint's project
2. WHEN a Sandbox_Environment exists for the project, THE Execution_View SHALL delegate request execution to the Sandbox_Service

5. WHEN executing a GET request with an ID in the URL in sandbox mode, THE Sandbox_Service SHALL return the specific Sandbox_Record matching the ID
6. WHEN executing a POST request in sandbox mode, THE Sandbox_Service SHALL create a new Sandbox_Record with the merged request body data
7. WHEN executing a PUT request in sandbox mode, THE Sandbox_Service SHALL replace the Sandbox_Record data with the merged request body
