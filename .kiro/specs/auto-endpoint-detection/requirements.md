# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Auto-Endpoint Detection feature enables users to upload their project folders as zip files, automatically analyze the code to detect API endpoints, extract endpoint details, and generate documentation. The system provides sandbox mode for public users to test endpoints with mock data, while project owners can test with live API calls. The feature leverages Groq AI for intelligent code analysis and supports multiple programming languages and frameworks.

2. WHEN a zip file is uploaded, THE Upload_Service SHALL extract the contents to a secure temporary directory
3. IF the uploaded file is not a valid zip file, THEN THE Upload_Service SHALL return an error message indicating invalid file format
4. IF the uploaded file exceeds 100MB, THEN THE Upload_Service SHALL suggest using GitHub repository URL instead
5. WHEN a Project_Owner provides a GitHub repository URL, THE Upload_Service SHALL clone the repository to a secure temporary directory

5. THE Documentation_Generator SHALL format documentation in a human-readable structure

### Requirement 6: Execute Endpoints in Sandbox Mode

**User Story:** As a Public_User, I want to test API endpoints with mock data, so that I can understand how the API works without affecting real data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a Public_User requests to test an endpoint, THE Execution_Service SHALL execute the endpoint in Sandbox_Mode
2. WHILE in Sandbox_Mode, THE Execution_Service SHALL use mock data instead of making real API calls
