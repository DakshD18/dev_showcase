## 🎯 Demo Scenarios

### Scenario 1: New User Registration
1. Use an email that doesn't have an account
2. Send magic link
3. Click link
4. Show: "User created automatically!"
5. Now logged in with full access

### Scenario 2: Existing User Login
1. Use your email (amey020607@gmail.com)
2. Send magic link
3. Click link
4. Show: "Logged in instantly!"

### Scenario 3: Security Demo
1. Send magic link
2. Click it once (works)
3. Try clicking the same link again
4. Show: "Link has expired or already been used"

## 📊 Technical Architecture (if asked)

```
User enters email
    ↓
Frontend sends POST to /api/auth/magic-link/request/
    ↓
Backend generates secure token (secrets.token_urlsafe)
    ↓
Token stored in database with expiration (15 min)
    ↓
Email sent via Gmail SMTP
    ↓
User clicks link in email
    ↓
Frontend sends token to /api/auth/magic-link/verify/
    ↓
Backend validates token (not expired, not used)
    ↓
User created/retrieved from database
    ↓
Auth token generated and returned
    ↓
User logged in, redirected to dashboard
```

## 🔥 Bonus Points

### If Professor Asks: "Why Magic Links?"

> "Magic links are becoming the industry standard for modern applications. Companies like Slack, Medium, and Notion use them because they:
> - Reduce support costs (no password resets)
> - Improve security (no weak passwords)
> - Increase conversion rates (easier signup)
> - Provide better UX (one-click login)"

### If Professor Asks: "What about security?"

> "Magic links are actually more secure than passwords because:
> - Tokens are cryptographically random (32 bytes)
> - They expire automatically (15 minutes)
> - They're one-time use only
> - Email access is required (2-factor by nature)
> - No password database to breach"

### If Professor Asks: "Can you scale this?"

> "Absolutely! The architecture is production-ready:
> - Stateless authentication (JWT tokens)
> - Database-backed token storage
> - Environment-based configuration
> - Can switch to dedicated email services (SendGrid, AWS SES)
> - Rate limiting can be added easily
> - Works with load balancers and multiple servers"
